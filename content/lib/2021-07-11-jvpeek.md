yes. hi. hello. me again.

A kind German gentlemen named [@jvpeek](https://twitch.tv/jvpeek) popped into my twitch stream and had a challenge for me.

---

# Starting the challenge

He just shared this string without any other context. So naturally I was fucking hooked.

```
dWdnY2Y6Ly93aWNycngucXIvY3lodC53Y3Q=
```

### Base64

It ended with an `=` or `==` so I believed it was `base64` encoded data. (Thanks Kubernetes!)

```
echo "dWdnY2Y6Ly93aWNycngucXIvY3lodC53Y3Q=" | base64 -d
uggcf://wicrrx.qr/cyht.wct
```

### ROT-13 Cypher

This looked like a 1:1 cypher also known as a [ROT-13 cypher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13)

which would mean that the message is rotating by 13 characters

```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10111213 
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
n o p q r s t u v w x y z a b c d e f g h i j k l m
```

So the decoded message would look like

```
uggcf://wicrrx.qr/cyht.wct
https://jvpeek.de/plug.jpg
```

### plug.jpg

I was smart enough to know not to download a random `.jpg` from the internet without investigating it first. So

```
wget https://jvpeek.de/plug.jpg
```

I then looked into the file with a few tools

```
emacs # Just to check the file out

file plug.jpg
plug.jpg: JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, aspect ratio, density 1x1, segment length 16, progressive, precision 8, 700x690, components 3

steghide # Can hide messages
stegseek # Will try to find messages

binwalk # Used to embed files in the image

```

### binwalk

Then I discovered there was an embedded `.zip` in the image!

```
DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0             0x0             JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01
43258         0xA8FA          Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract, compressed size: 9252, uncompressed size: 11248, name: tt.png
52634         0xCD9A          End of Zip archive, footer length: 22

```

So I extracted the zip archive!

```
binwalk -e plug.jpg
```

Where I found two files

```
ls
A8FA.zip  tt.png
```

### tt.png

I opened up `tt.png` in [gimp](https://gimp.org) and discovered a message hidden in the image itself.

![](/assets/img/tt.png)

I found `742` in the corner.

### first youtube video

After finding the URL for the original image, I found a game on the main page.

You can go to [jvpeek.de](https://jvpeek.de/).

I entered the `742` code into the keypad and found a new string by highlighting data on the page.

Turns out there are common paradigms for hiding messages in teletext in other countries.

This one lost me, but if you look around the blob of text you notice `YT` and it clearly is a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi5jzQtYG6I)

{{< youtube id="Hi5jzQtYG6I" >}}

We got a clue to check out the audio and used `youtube-dl` to download the `.wav` of the audio.

```
youtube-dl -x --audio-format wav https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi5jzQtYG6I
```

### audacity

We opened up the audio in [audacity](https://github.com/tenacityteam/tenacity) which made me laugh given the current affairs of the project.

More: [drama](https://github.com/tenacityteam/tenacity/issues/99)

After opening the `.wav` file in audacity I started to check a few things.

The title of the video had `1200` in the title, so naturally I peaked out the graphic equalizer around 1200 (and enveloped the nearby frequencies).

### minimodem

We then got a tip to use a tool called `minimodem` which the man page suggested using a baud rate of 300.

We replaced the baud rate with 1200

```
minimodem -r 1200 
```

and peaked out the signal in audacity with an amplifier and ensured there was no clipping. We also reverted our EQ bandpass.

We played the sample from the youtube video and changed the `minimodem` pulseaudio input to my local audio stream.

### Flag

What we found changed my life forever.

![](/assets/img/qr.png)

I won't spoil the suprise (I clipped the bottom few lines of the QR code).

You should have everything you need to find the final message and the flag!

# Conclusion

Great CTF, in a very unusual way.

Thanks to [@jvpeek](https://twitch.tv/jvpeek) for setting this up.

Make sure to give him a follow!
