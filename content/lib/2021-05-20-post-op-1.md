# surgery day

i snapped a few selfies while i was waiting to go into the operating room. i'll share those in a moment.

### detaching from my body

this might be a bit odd, but i really felt lucky about having such a concrete out-of-body experience. 

i really believe that there are 2 main components to me as a person 

 - the body (meat sack if you will)
 - the soul / my mind / me 

i feel like my job as a "driver" in my life, is to use my body as a little vehicle for my adventures in life. 

here are some surgery thoughts i scribbled down on my phone (i do not remember writing these). however -- i feel like these are pretty great 🙂

needless to say i felt very much like climbing, and my practice of being able to detach my bodily fears from my mental fears really came in handy.

i am proud to report i was very calm and peaceful through the entire process. 

# before 

notice a few things 

 - distance from eyebrows to eye balls
 - distance from eyebrows to hair line 
 - curve of eye brows

# first day home 

after 24 hours in the hospital - i was sent home with a full face dressing - this dressing will be on for the next week or so.

# conclusion 

the surgeon [Dr. Deschamps-Braly](https://deschamps-braly.com/) had remarkable and meticulous dexterity with his work. 
even my primary care doctor agreed his work was beautiful.

anyway - next week we should have our first glimpses into the "new" naked face.

i could cry - im so happy to finally have parts of what felt like my soul - given back to me.

i truly feel like my innocence was slightly restored. the scars of my life and childhood are finally reflected physically.
