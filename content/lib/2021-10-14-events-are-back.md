Hello ðŸ™‚ me again. This week I am back at my first in person event since lockdown.

Please enjoy my opinions, they are my own, and this website is where I share them.

If you don't like them, please do let me know on Twitter.

# A new perspective

So recently I have taken a new job at [Twilio, Inc](https://twilio.com). 

I do my best to keep my personal life as separated as possible from my day job, although as I grow in my career maintaining a healthy balance between these things takes more and more of my time.

I have been attending KubeCon Events since my first commit to Kubernetes in 2016. 

This event was a bit new for me, I was walking around with a new agenda on my mind. You see, traditionally my job had me in the mindset of a developer advocate. Which (_unfortunately_) meant that my employers at the time had a lot of pressure on me to be "famous" and be "visible". Traditionally there was a lot of pressure to connect on Twitter, drink alcohol, have elaborate meals with large groups of people, visit booths, and just be "the life of the party" for lack of a better term. 

This time however, I came on **my terms**. I deliberately carved out the trip at the office. I advocated for myself to come. This trip is a reflection of my initiative at Twilio. It is my design, and my agenda that is bringing me back to KubeCon. I want to listen to vendors, and observe the ecosystem. I want to listen to people's frustration and pain points and try to put myself in their shoes. 

My new role at Twilio has positioned me as the lead architect for our internal infrastructure, which will be built out on Linux, Kubernetes, and some public cloud provider services. 

### Reflection

To be honest, it has been very refreshing to be able to take advantage of this event for me, than to feel like I am being taken advantage of by the event for my companies best interest. 

This whole experience has left me with thoughts of complexity in the market, and the economy of open source software. I do believe the industry is in a downward innovate dip. I don't think we are going to see any large innovate disruptions for a few years. Which (in my mind) means it's time to go heads down and focus on finding components of the space that work well.

In other words, as I position myself for this dip over the next few years there is one question that I will carry with me in my life.

To be slightly more direct, I have seen (and validated) that a lot of technical practices, and advice may not be the best solution for teams right now. There are of course plenty of very effective techniques and tools available. There is simply just an overwhelming abundance of "solutions" available. I think it might be time to evaluate the tools available and get back to simplifying our infrastructure and opting-in when completely necessary. In other words, I think I will be approaching the market slightly more conservatively for a while. 

# Closing

In my opinion it's going to take time before we see another large turnover in the technical landscape. I suspect we see a handful of smaller, quicker turnovers before we see anything large (again).

In the meantime - I am happy to be back here with my friends, colleagues, and co-maintainers. KubeCon has been a fabulous experience, as per usual. ðŸ™‚
