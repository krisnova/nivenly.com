yes. hi. hello. me again.

today let's talk about building a firewall for my voluptuous rack.

i [tweeted](https://twitter.com/krisnova/status/1373020826551808000?s=20) about building a PFsense firewall for the rack at the house.

these are my **key takeaways** after 5 minutes of research about building a firewall at the house.

# use cases and constraints

let's break this down into 2 sets of use cases, and hopefully we can find a solution to as many as possible.

## firewall

I want TCP/UDP port level controls. period.

#### examples:

normally this is something we can do with `iptables` or `ufw` but we are mutating network entities in the kernel of the host we need to protect from.
we genuinely have a solid use case for external hardware specific, kernel based firewalling.

 - block all TCP traffic on 3000-32767 `0.0.0.0/0`
 - block all TCP traffic except from `10.0.0.0/24` 
 - allow all TCP traffic on 22, 80, 443 from `0.0.0.0/0`

## routing

broken down by NICs `[x]`

 - [X] outbound masquerade failover WAN `96.82.77.33/29`
 - [X] SNAT rules for Kubernetes  
     - [ ] SNAT traffic from `96.82.77.34/29` -> `10.0.0.188/32` (`alice`)
     - [ ] SNAT traffic from `96.82.77.35/29` -> (`yakko`)
     - [ ] SNAT traffic from `96.82.77.36/29` -> (`wakko`)
     - [ ] SNAT traffic from `96.82.77.37/29` -> (`dot`)
 - [X] inbound LAN `10.0.0.1/24`

## security 

this is kernel/operating system level security concerns 

 - layer 7 inspection
 - packet caputers
 - pen testing lab  
 - running public facing interface unencrypted
 - running public facing interface as root

# software decision (OPNsense vs PFsense)

i have decided to go with `opnsense` for the software layer.

### PFsense is shady as fuck

checkout this [court transcript](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/search/text.jsp?case=D2017-1828) that shows PFsense doing some shady shit with OPNsense.org domains.

furthermore there is some open source concerns i have with the build tools, and the ethics of the `pfsense` org in general.
more detail:

 - [teklager blog](https://teklager.se/en/pfsense-vs-opnsense) has more information about ethics
 - [opnsense.org](https://docs.opnsense.org/history/thefork.html) posted their reasons for forking `pfsense`

# hardware decision 

i decided to go with the `Supermicro SuperServer SYS-E300-9D` you can find it [here on amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/prodct/B07DFVWZH7/ref=ewc_pr_img_2?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&psc=1)

here you can [find the spec sheet](https://tinkertry.com/supermicro-superserver-sys-e300-9d-first-look)

### more specs we host

 - [Supermicro SuperServer SYS-E300-9D PDF](/assets/docs/Supermicro-SuperServer-SYS-E300-9D.pdf)
 - [Intel X722 RJ45 1GbE/10GbE NICs PDF](/assets/docs/ethernet-network-adapter-x722-product-brief.pdf)

### reasons for my decision 

 - we wanted to rackmount this in the rack ([19 inch rack kit here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071188SDC/ref=ewc_pr_img_1?smid=AEELF2HAVZFED&psc=1))
 - we wanted SFP hardware to develop on
 - we wanted up to 10G intel NICs to develop on
 - we wanted IPMI nic for IPMI experiments on kubernetes with controllers


# more to come

stay tuned as we set up our hardware and software over the next few streams
