## About

This is an independently published book about modeling the tech industry.

Particularly this book will model computers, humans, and money and their
subsequent relationships. 


{{< book-2022 >}}


### Written for Marginalized Technologists

This book is designed so that anyone will find
value, however it specifically designed to give marginalized technologists (LGBTQ, Black people, People of Color, Women, Non-binary, Gender minorities, Neurodivergent, and more)
a set of tools in aiding their ability to exploit a fundamentally
unbalanced system. 

### Think like a Hacker

This book draws inspiration from my professional history
in Linux and Kubernetes security, distributed threat modeling, kernel
security, and cloud infrastructure for techniques on modeling and
exploiting the system that is the Silicon Valley tech industry. If you
enjoy linear thinking, modeling complex relationships as systems, and
learning about the strategy I developed to become a Senior Principal
Engineer in Silicon Valley, this book is for you.

### Model the Industry like a System

The primary goal of this book is to model the system of the tech industry
such that you can leverage this knowledge for your own initiative.

### Privilege Escalate to the Top

A secondary goal of this book will be enabling you to privilege escalate
yourself to the level of the elite in tech. We aim to equip you such that
you can eventually outperform them.

### Leverage The System

Upon finishing the book you should have a comprehensive understanding of
the psychological and economic impact the tech industry has on its self,
yourself, and the rest the world. You will learn how to predict the
system’s behavior, and how to protect yourself while existing within the
system. 

You will learn proven techniques on navigating the tech industry
while setting yourself up for success based on your goals.
The system is the tech industry. The tech industry is the system. This book
will teach you how to hack it.
