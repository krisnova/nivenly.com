### About

This is an independently published book about modeling the tech industry.

Learn how to model computers, humans, money, and their subsequent relationships for your own personal gain.


### Written For Less Privileged Technologists

This book is relevant for anyone in tech, however it is specifically designed to give less privileged technologists (LGBTQ, People of Color, Women, Non-binary, Gender minorities, Neurodivergent, etc...) a set of tools in aiding their ability to exploit a fundamentally broken system.

This book is for anyone who has ever been held back, limited, or been denied access to their future because of money.

Learn how the privileged at the top think about the industry, so you can out smart them.

This book is written from my perspective.
In my eyes, I view myself as a successful transgender hacker. 

This book is a "Day 2" overview of the tech industry with a focus on exploitation for profit.
This book will not teach you how to enter the tech industry.
However, this book will teach you the critical skills required to going from an entry level position to a lucrative top level position.
