# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We are focusing our security updates on the following versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.7.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.6.x   | :warning:          |
| < 1.6   | :x:                |

## :warning: Versions

Versions with :warning: will be supported for security issues, however you won't be able to update to them, you will need to manually update through the [`direct-install` command](https://learn.getgrav.org/17/admin-panel/tools).

If you cannot update to the latest stable version available because, for example, your server does not meet the minimum PHP requirements, you can manually install a previous version by downloading the package from our Releases directory (https://github.com/getgrav/grav/releases).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please contact security@getgrav.org with a detailed explaination of the security issue found and we will work with you to get it resolved as fast as possible.
