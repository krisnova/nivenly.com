		<title>Comment on The Secret of Microsoft Emails J by Yu</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Found your article when I looked into why Emails from my superior look a bit wonky in terms of formatting. Mostly, I wondered why the font size and color deemphasize his text so much, that I suddenly mistake his reply for my own email, because the &quot;quote&quot; part is much more readable, simply because it uses standard font size, standard font color and standard font family.

Which is really what should happen by default. Unless explicitly demanded otherwise by the user, no formattings should ever be applied. If the user, or the users company sets up a template for corporate design reasons, that&#039;s legitimate. But the *default* should always be to *not* apply unexpected formatting.

So much for &quot;Old Outlook clients&quot;. Sadly, meaning &quot;still around outlook clients&quot;.

I&#039;m also not sure if encoding everything in base64 by default is a good idea, though I can imagine, that microsoft wanted to safeguard against Emails getting mangled when processed by some outdated mail servers.]]></description>
