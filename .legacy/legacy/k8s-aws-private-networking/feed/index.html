Thank you very much for this article, it has been very useful for me.  I only have a question about to upgrade the cluster to use Kubernetes 1.5.0, I need it in order to use cronJobs, that I guess there are some issues with the version 1.4.7 of Kubernetes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kris,

Thanks for the great article!  This was very helpful.  Is it possible to use kops to set up a cluster in a VPC that already exists?  If possible ,would you be able to provide any details regarding this option?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m trying to use kops version 1.5.0-alpha2.

Is the image &quot;293135079892/k8s-1.4-debian-jessie-amd64-hvm-ebs-2016-11-16&quot; still required at this point?

Is it possible for me to use a recent version of CoreOS if I wanted?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Lawernce

Unfortunately the private topology feature hasn&#039;t made it into an official release, although its scheduled VERY soon. So for now you will need to continue to pass the --image flag until the feature has made it into a release. 

There will be a little PR around the release when it finally drops - and I will probably get another article out shortly with the newer features.

Hope this helps, and thanks for the feedback. Thanks for using kops!]]></description>
