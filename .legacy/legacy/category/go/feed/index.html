				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;">Earlier this year I found myself taking a much needed break from employment.</h3>

I was astonished and overwhelmed at the interest I had from amazing organizations in the Cloud Native ecosystem. I met with large tech companies, startups, and entrepreneurs yet to start their journey. I noticed everyone was very excited about Kubernetes. Every meeting shared the common theme. It seemed like the entire industry was obsessed with solving their unique problems with our new distributed kernel: Kubernetes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>There was only one problem:  <strong>Kubernetes is effectively &#8220;complete&#8221;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Don&#8217;t get me wrong, there is still a lot of work to do and Kubernetes will always have room for improvement.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My point here is that the core functionality of Kubernetes has not only been completed, but iterated on several times over. The scope of the project is relatively finite, and we have reached a point of maturity where we have functional components to satisfy this scope. The API is several versions deep, and the goal of the project was to provide a platform for the ecosystem to build on. We have achieved that. With that being said, taking another &#8220;Kubernetes Centric&#8221; role didn&#8217;t seem very attractive to me. I love Kubernetes and have been working with the core upstream community for a long time, but I think it&#8217;s time to pivot slightly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">I am an innovator.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">One could argue the majority of innovation <strong>within</strong> Kubernetes has long since been crafted, whereas innovation <strong>with</strong> Kubernetes is just beginning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Regardless, I am convinced Kubernetes is here to stay.</h3>
<p><img class=" wp-image-677 alignleft" src="http://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/k8s-300x300.png" alt="" width="167" height="167" srcset="https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/k8s-300x300.png 300w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/k8s-150x150.png 150w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/k8s-350x350.png 350w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/k8s.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 167px) 100vw, 167px" /></p>
<p>As the new Cloud Native &#8220;kernel&#8221; for distributed systems management, Kubernetes surely won&#8217;t be disappearing from my career any time soon. Nor will the CNCF. As a Kubernetes expert naturally I began my investigation into discovering technology that solved real problems in unique and powerful ways. I really wanted to find technology that I believed in, that I still hadn&#8217;t mastered, and that would get me excited. I wanted to go deeper into the little black boxes that still seemed like magic to me. I wanted more. I found myself speaking with many companies and looked at a lot of open source tools: service meshes, networking tools, deployment tools, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">There was one company that stood out&#8230;</h1>
<p><img class=" wp-image-748 aligncenter" src="http://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sysdig-social-sharing-logo-500x500-300x300.png" alt="" width="138" height="138" srcset="https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sysdig-social-sharing-logo-500x500-300x300.png 300w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sysdig-social-sharing-logo-500x500-150x150.png 150w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sysdig-social-sharing-logo-500x500-350x350.png 350w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sysdig-social-sharing-logo-500x500.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 138px) 100vw, 138px" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">I see the potential in gaining visibility into our systems at the kernel level, while operating a containerized system on top.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Period.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://sysdig.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="wp-image-749 alignleft" src="http://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/twitter-share-sysdig-300x288.png" alt="" width="80" height="77" srcset="https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/twitter-share-sysdig-300x288.png 300w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/twitter-share-sysdig-768x736.png 768w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/twitter-share-sysdig-600x575.png 600w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/twitter-share-sysdig-365x350.png 365w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/twitter-share-sysdig.png 868w" sizes="(max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px" /></a>Furthermore there are a lot of other reasons I made the choice I did. To be be completely honest I simply fell in love with the way everyone worked. They were a low level shop of hackers and genuine people. Everyone I met was empowered and knew precisely what they were talking about. It was a refreshing interviewing experience. Good friends from open source like the infamous POP truly helped make me feel welcomed and respected. During my interview we white boarded the Linux kernel not to pass a frivolous test, but because we genuinely needed the diagram for our discussion on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Packet_Filter">eBPF.</a> I immediately knew that this job was going to push me forward technically. I loved it.</p>
<p>As the saga goes, the company offered me a position to take on ownership of our open source tools and I was thrilled. I am quite excited for our team, and an opportunity to do what I love doing: inspiring engineers and solving concrete problems with them!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>So let&#8217;s talk Falco.</strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of my new role at Sysdig I will be managing our OSS team, while simultaneously working on our tools with them. I am way too excited about new friends in <a href="https://github.com/cncf/sig-security">Kubernetes SIG-security</a>. Growing Falco and driving adoption will be a primary goal for me at Sysdig. We want to flesh Falco out as the defacto way of pulling metrics from the kernel for runtime security and intrusion detection.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://falco.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="wp-image-776 alignright" src="http://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/falco-logo-300x120.png" alt="" width="430" height="172" srcset="https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/falco-logo-300x120.png 300w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/falco-logo-768x306.png 768w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/falco-logo-1024x408.png 1024w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/falco-logo-750x299.png 750w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/falco-logo-878x350.png 878w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/falco-logo.png 1192w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" /></a></strong>Once upon a time a simple network packet had every bit of information you needed for total forensics analysis. Today with Kubernetes abstractions sharing network, disk, and memory across containerized process the network is no longer a viable avenue for learning about our complete systems behavior. This is where Falco and eBPF come into the picture.</p>
<p>Falco uses two critical components into gaining visibility of our systems. The first is a comprehensive list of syscall information that we access via eBPF. The second is our context from Kubernetes. By joining these two otherwise completely separated bits of data together, we now have everything we need to secure a Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<p>Falco allows users to dynamically build rules against this rich data set, and can take action if and when a rule is broken. This noninvasive and elegant approach to security is built on battle tested concepts, applied in exciting new ways. To be honest, I can&#8217;t wait to start hacking on the kernel with the rest of the folks on the team. I am excited to go deeper into kernel security with eBPF and Falco.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Okay &#8211; wow &#8211; it&#8217;s been a long time since I have blogged here&#8230;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">❤️ Hi everyone! I missed you! ❤️</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="github.com/kubicorn/kubicorn"><img class="alignleft" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubicorn/kubicorn/master/docs/img/kubicorn-trans.png" alt="" width="212" height="236" /></a>So due to some unforeseen circumstance in the past ~year or so&#8230; I was unable to continue contributing to my <strong>pride</strong> and <strong>joy</strong> <a href="https://github.com/kubicorn/kubicorn">Kubicorn!</a> It&#8217;s been a real bummer, but I am glad to say that those days are officially behind me!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The good news? I am back! And we are working hard on making <code>kubicorn</code> even more amazing!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So without further delay, let&#8217;s start looking into what I wanted to update everyone about <code>kubicorn</code>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>What is <a href="http://github.com/kubicorn/kubicorn"><code>kubicorn</code></a>?</h1>
<h3>Kubicorn is a Kubernetes infrastructure management tool!</h3>
<p><code>kubicorn</code> attempts to solve managing kubernetes based infrastructure in a cloud native way. The project is supported by the <a href="https://www.cncf.io">Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) </a> and attempts to offer a few things unique to cloud native infrastructure:</p>
<ol>
<li>Modular components</li>
<li>Vendorable library in Go</li>
<li>A guarantee-less framework that is flexible and scalable</li>
<li>A solid way to bootstrap and manage your infrastructure</li>
<li>Software to manage infrastructure</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These patterns are fundamental to understanding cloud native technologies, and (in my opinion) are the future of infrastructure management!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>How do I know this? I literally <a href="http://www.cnibook.info">wrote the book on it</a>&#8230;</em></p>
<p>TLDR; It&#8217;s a badass command line tool that goes from <code>0</code>to <code>kubernetes</code> in just a few moments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>What&#8217;s new in <a href="http://github.com/kubicorn/kubicorn"><code>kubicorn</code></a>?</h1>
<h3>We have officially adopted the Kubernetes cluster API</h3>
<p>The cluster API is an official working group in the Kubernetes community.</p>
<p>The pattern dictates that while bootstrapping a cluster, <code>kubicorn</code> will first create the Kubernetes control plane.</p>
<p>Then <code>kubicorn</code> will define the control plane itself, as well as the machines that will serve as the nodes (workhorses) of the Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<p>Finally, <code>kubicorn</code>will install a controller that will realize the machines defined in the previous step.</p>
<p>This allows for arbitrary clients to adjust the machine definition, without having to care how <code>kubicorn</code> will <strong>autoscale</strong> their cluster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/k8s.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-677 size-thumbnail" src="http://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/k8s-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/k8s-150x150.png 150w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/k8s-300x300.png 300w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/k8s-350x350.png 350w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/k8s.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Autoscaling infrastructure, the kubernetes way!</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kubicorn-patten.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-676 size-full" src="http://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kubicorn-patten.png" alt="" width="512" height="402" srcset="https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kubicorn-patten.png 512w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kubicorn-patten-300x236.png 300w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kubicorn-patten-446x350.png 446w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></a></p>
<p>So this is an official working group of Kubernetes, and more information can be found <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/wg-cluster-api">here</a>!</p>
<p>We are currently working on building out this framework, and if you think it is a good idea (like we do) feel free to get involved.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://slack.k8s.io/">Slack channel</a> #kubicorn</li>
<li><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubicorn-users-and-developers">Mailing List (with calendar invite to developer calls)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kubicorn/kubicorn">Github</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>We have a dope website</h3>
<p><a href="http://kubicorn.io">kubicorn.io</a></p>
<p>So many thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/ellenkorbes">Ellen</a> for her hard work in building out our fabulous site. If you would like to contribute please let us know!</p>
<h3>We have moved to our own GitHub organization</h3>
<p>Despite my attempts to keep the project as one of my pets, it&#8217;s just gotten too big. It has now moved to it&#8217;s own organization. We would love for YOU to get involved. Just open up an issue or contact <strong>Kris Nova</strong> if you would like to join.</p>
<h3>We are just now starting on the controller</h3>
<p>Writing the infrastructure controller is probably the most exciting thing to happen to the project yet.</p>
<p>We literally JUST started the <a href="https://github.com/kubicorn/controller">repository</a>. Get in now, while the getting is good!</p>
<p>We need help with the Dockerfile, with the idea behind the controller, and even with the code to make it so. If you wan&#8217;t to get involved, now is your chance!</p>
<h3>We want your help</h3>
<p>Seriously.</p>
<p>Our lead maintainer <a href="https://twitter.com/xmudrii">Marko</a> started out as someone on the internet just like you. He is now a super admin of the project, and is a rock star at keeping up with the day-to-day work of <code>kubicorn</code>.</p>
<p>We would love to help you become a cloud native badass if you would like to contribute. Please join the <a href="http://slack.k8s.io/">slack channel</a> and start talking to us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>My contact information. This will make more sense later.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like all good blog posts. This too started out as a tweet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The conversation was regarding me changing my Twitter handle, and Justin was bringing up a great point. Which is that my Twitter handle is hard-coded all over the internet. My engineer brain instantly started to draft up solutions to this problem, as I realized this was the perfect use case for pointer pointers!</p>
<h1></h1>
<h1>Pointers in Go</h1>
<p>Now if you are new to pointers in Go don&#8217;t worry. Pointers are easy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Just think of pointers as URLs!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Seriously, a URL is just a <strong>pointer</strong> to a web page. In this case the URL itself (say https://nivenly.com) is the <strong>address</strong> and whatever the web page returns is it&#8217;s <strong>value</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">See? Pretty easy right. I told you pointers were no big deal.</p>
<h1></h1>
<h1>Pointer Pointers</h1>
<p>So in the case of changing my contact information, let&#8217;s take a look at how things are today.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-638 size-full" src="http://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Untitled-Diagram-1.png" alt="" width="741" height="488" srcset="https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Untitled-Diagram-1.png 741w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Untitled-Diagram-1-300x198.png 300w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Untitled-Diagram-1-531x350.png 531w" sizes="(max-width: 741px) 100vw, 741px" /></p>
<p>Notice how in this model, if I need to revise my contact information I would need to go an update every page on the internet that has my contact information linked to it. If we had a <strong>pointer page</strong> we could safely hard code all the pages on the internet to one page that I control. Say a page on my blog for instance. Then if we needed to update anything all we need to do is update the <strong>pointer page.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-636 size-full" src="http://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Untitled-Diagram.png" alt="" width="741" height="488" srcset="https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Untitled-Diagram.png 741w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Untitled-Diagram-300x198.png 300w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Untitled-Diagram-531x350.png 531w" sizes="(max-width: 741px) 100vw, 741px" /></p>
<p>In this model, we no longer need to make a change to the web page on the internet as it will also be pointing to the <strong>pointer page</strong>.</p>
<h1>An example in Go</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below is a concrete example of pointer pointers in Go, using the use case from the tweet. Needing to change your twitter URL without changing the higher level implementation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre class="brush: golang; title: ; notranslate">

package main

import (
	&quot;fmt&quot;
)

type ContactInfo struct {

	Twitter string
	LinkedIn string
	GitHub string

}

func main() {
	
	// -----------------------------------------------------
	// First version of my contact information
	kris := &amp;ContactInfo{
		Twitter: &quot;https://twitter.com/kris__nova&quot;,
		LinkedIn: &quot;https://linkedin.com/in/kris-nova/&quot;,
		GitHub: &quot;https://github.com/kris-nova&quot;,
	}


	// -----------------------------------------------------
	// Assign my contact information as a pointer pointer
	myContactInfo := &amp;kris
	fmt.Println(**myContactInfo)
	
	
	// -----------------------------------------------------
	// Second version of my contact information
	kris = &amp;ContactInfo{
		Twitter: &quot;https://twitter.com/krisnova&quot;,
		LinkedIn: &quot;https://linkedin.com/in/kris-nova/&quot;,
		GitHub: &quot;https://github.com/kris-nova&quot;,
	}
	
	
	
	// -----------------------------------------------------
	// Feel free to hard code myContactInfo anywhere and I 
	// can change it right from underneath you!
	fmt.Println(**myContactInfo)
}

</pre>
<p>Run it <a href="https://play.golang.org/p/FnQDEwaFyY">on the Go playground</a>!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheersthanks!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So hanging out at GothamGo this year has been inspirational! I have been able to rub elbows with the best of the best Go engineers <strong>in the world</strong>.</p>
<p>Last night I was introduced to what I think is..</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>..finally the solution to generics in Go!</strong></p>
<h1>The G Package</h1>
<figure id="attachment_615" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://github.com/stabbycutyou/generics"><img class="wp-image-615 size-medium" src="http://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-05-at-5.42.36-AM-300x47.png" alt="" width="300" height="47" srcset="https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-05-at-5.42.36-AM-300x47.png 300w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-05-at-5.42.36-AM.png 508w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Generics Package</figcaption></figure>
<p>So there is an <strong>Apache 2 open source</strong> licensed package that can be found on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/stabbycutyou/generics">here</a>. &#8216;</p>
<p>The package is <strong>clean, </strong>and <strong>elegant</strong>. So let&#8217;s take the package for a spin!</p>
<p>First things first, we need to install the G package. Luckily it using the Go idiomatic installation method <code>go get</code>.</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">

go get github.com/StabbyCutyou/generics

</pre>
<p>Now we can import the package into our Go program.</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">

import . &quot;github.com/StabbyCutyou/generics&quot;

</pre>
<h1>The Implementation</h1>
<p>We can now take ugly and non idiomatic (but flexible) Go code such as the following and implement a much more elegant solution for Generics.</p>
<pre class="brush: golang; title: ; notranslate">

func UglyUnIdiomaticQuoteGenericApproachUnquote(poorexcuse ...interface{}) []interface{}

</pre>
<p>with the G package now becomes the following</p>
<pre class="brush: golang; title: ; notranslate">

func Excellence(things ...G) []G

</pre>
<h1>Backwards Compatibility</h1>
<p>From the G package repository we can read a glorious compatibility statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>G meets the standard of golang by matching its stance on backwards compatibility. Until a 2.0 release of generics, which may never happen, G will always be 100% Backwards compatible with it&#8217;s initial 1.0 release.</p></blockquote>
<h1>Behind The Scenes</h1>
<p>The source code for G is simple and elegant, and I encourage all users to <a href="https://github.com/StabbyCutyou/generics/blob/master/g.go">take a peak at what is going on behind the scenes</a>. In my eyes it is a clean solution to Generics in Go, and I couldn&#8217;t be more pleased with the project.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I am working on a Go speech today, and I got to a slide where I wanted to mention the C# programming language. Or more importantly, I wanted to mention how some internal teams at Microsoft are switching over from C# to Go!</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-598 alignright" src="http://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_2-300x216.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="216" srcset="https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_2-300x216.jpeg 300w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_2-768x554.jpeg 768w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_2-1024x739.jpeg 1024w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_2-750x541.jpeg 750w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_2-485x350.jpeg 485w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_2.jpeg 1458w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The only problem with this slide is that I am supposed to be somewhat credible in what I say..</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong> and I have never written a line of C# in my life. </strong></p>
<p>Furthermore I run <strong>linux</strong> as my primary operating system. So of course I decided it would be a good idea to try to get a <strong>C#</strong> development environment up and and running on <strong>Archlinux</strong>. After a total of <strong>10 seconds of searching Google</strong> I couldn&#8217;t find the step-by-step tutorial I wanted so naturally I am creating one.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">So here goes&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Install VS Code</h1>
<figure id="attachment_601" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screenshot-from-2017-10-03-09-47-15.png"><img class="wp-image-601 size-medium" src="http://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screenshot-from-2017-10-03-09-47-15-300x185.png" alt="" width="300" height="185" srcset="https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screenshot-from-2017-10-03-09-47-15-300x185.png 300w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screenshot-from-2017-10-03-09-47-15-567x350.png 567w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screenshot-from-2017-10-03-09-47-15.png 662w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">C# isn&#8217;t scary at all!</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=linux64">Download page for Linux</a></p>
<p><a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=620884">Tarball for Linux</a></p>
<p>Okay so you don&#8217;t need VS code, but the <strong>C#</strong> plugin is really legit. It feels like any other programming language!</p>
<p>But feel free to use any text editor you like. We are just going to be banging out a quick and dirty hello world.</p>
<p>If you plan on writing copious amounts of <strong>C#</strong> I strongly suggest you get VS code. It&#8217;s free and works fantastically on Linux.</p>
<h1>Install Mono</h1>
<p>(Seriously this is all you do)</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">

sudo pacman -S mono

</pre>
<h1>Write your hello world program</h1>
<p>Create a new file called <code>HelloWorld.cs</code> anywhere on your file system.</p>
<p><strong>HelloWorld.cs</strong></p>
<pre class="brush: csharp; title: ; notranslate">
// A Hello World! program in C#.
using System;
namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Hello 
    {
        static void Main() 
        {
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);

            // Keep the console window open in debug mode.
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;Press any key to exit.&quot;);
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>Thanks to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/hello-world-your-first-program">official Microsoft docs</a> for the code snippet!</p>
<h1>Compile</h1>
<p>The mono <code>mcs</code> compiler works very similar to <code>gcc</code> and accepts an <code>-out</code> flag to specify the name of the executable.</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">

mcs -out:helloexe HelloWorld.cs

</pre>
<h1>Run</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">Then you can run your program!</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">

mono hello.exe

</pre>
<p><img class="wp-image-607 size-full aligncenter" src="http://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screenshot-from-2017-10-03-10-16-43.png" alt="" width="389" height="255" srcset="https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screenshot-from-2017-10-03-10-16-43.png 389w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screenshot-from-2017-10-03-10-16-43-300x197.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></p>
<h1>What&#8217;s next?</h1>
<p>I am going to do some benchmarking with <strong>C#</strong> and <strong>Go</strong> and explore some concurrency patterns between the two. Stay tuned for my findings!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>So a huge thanks to Hashiconf for letting me come out and talk about this stuff in person! But for those of you who missed it, or want more information there is also this blog on the matter as well.</p>
<p>So this is just a quick technical follow up of the tool <code>terraformctl</code> that I used in my session to get Terraform up and running inside of Kubernetes as a controller!</p>
<h1>What is terraformctl?</h1>
<p>A command line tool and gRPC server that is pronounced <strong>Terraform Cuddle</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kris-nova/terraformctl">The GitHub repo can be found here</a>!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a philosophical example of how infrastructure engineers might start looking at <strong>running cloud native applications to manage infrastructure</strong>. The idea behind the tool is to introduce this new way of thinking, and not necessarily to be the concrete implementation you are working for. This idea is new, and therefore a lot of tooling is till being crafted. This is just a quick and dirty example of what it <strong>might</strong> look like.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-578 size-full aligncenter" src="http://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/TerraformCTL-1.png" alt="" width="961" height="371" srcset="https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/TerraformCTL-1.png 961w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/TerraformCTL-1-300x116.png 300w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/TerraformCTL-1-768x296.png 768w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/TerraformCTL-1-750x290.png 750w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/TerraformCTL-1-907x350.png 907w" sizes="(max-width: 961px) 100vw, 961px" /></p>
<p>Terraformctl follows a simple client/server pattern.</p>
<p>We use gRPC to define the protocol in which the client will communicate with the server.</p>
<p>The server is a program written in Golang that will handle incoming gRPC requests concurrently while running a control loop.</p>
<p>The incoming requests are cached to a mutex controlled shared point in memory.</p>
<p>The control loop reads from the shared memory.</p>
<p>Voila. Concurrent microservices in Go!</p>
<h1>What is cloud native infrastructure?</h1>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-580 size-medium" src="http://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/cnibook-229x300.png" alt="" width="229" height="300" srcset="https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/cnibook-229x300.png 229w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/cnibook-267x350.png 267w, https://www.nivenly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/cnibook.png 381w" sizes="(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px" />Well it&#8217;s this crazy idea that we should start looking at managing cloud native infrastructure in the same way we manage traditional cloud native applications.</p>
<p>If we treat <strong>infrastructure as software </strong>then we have no reason to run the software in legacy or traditional ways when we can truly concur our software by running it in a cloud native way. I love this idea so much that I helped author a book on the subject! <a href="http://cnibook.info">Feel free to check it out here</a>!</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the new way of looking at the stack is to start thinking of the layers that were traditionally managed in other ways as layers that are now managed by discreet and happy applications. These applications can be ran in containers, and orchestrated in the same ways that all other applications can. So why not do that? YOLO.</p>
<h1>What Terraformctl is not..</h1>
<p>Terraformctl is not (and will never be) production ready.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a demo tool, and it&#8217;s hacky. If you really want to expand on my work feel free to ping me, or just out right fork it. I don&#8217;t have time to maintain yet another open source project unfortunately.</p>
<p>Terraformctl is not designed to replace any enterprise solutions, it&#8217;s just a thought experiment. Solving these problems is extremely hard, so I just want more people to understand what is really going into these tools.</p>
<p>Furthermore there are a number of features not yet implemented in the code base, that the code base was structure for. Who knows, maybe one day I will get around to coding them. We will see.</p>
<p>If you really, really, really want to talk more about this project. Please email me at <strong>kris@nivenly.com</strong>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A well written sorting algorithm is hard to replace, and typically the ones that have been battle tested will stand the test of time and stick around for a while. The Go programming language offers a clean abstraction on top of a commonly used sorting algorithm. With the <code>sort</code>  package in the standard library a user can sort arbitrary types in arbitrary ways using a time-proven sorting algorithm.</p>
<p>The way Go has set this up for us is by defining an interface called the <code>sort.Interface</code>. The rule is that as long as a type implements to this interface, it can be sorted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">The <code>sort.Interface</code> interface</h3>
<pre class="brush: golang; title: ; notranslate">

type Interface interface {
       // Len is the number of elements in the collection.
       Len() int
       // Less reports whether the element with
       // index i should sort before the element with index j.
       Less(i, j int) bool
       // Swap swaps the elements with indexes i and j.
       Swap(i, j int)
}
</pre>
<p>The interface definition can be found <a href="https://golang.org/src/sort/sort.go?s=523:801#L6">here</a>. The interface defines 3 functions, all of which are critical to the success of the sort.</p>
<h6>Len()</h6>
<p>The sort works by dividing the length of a collection by 2. So we need a way to determine a length (or size) of a collection. Think of this like the <code>len()</code> function in Go, and usually the <code>len()</code> function is appropriate to use here.</p>
<h6>Less()</h6>
<p>This is a function that will receive 2 integer indices from the collection. The algorithm assumes the implementation will perform <strong>some</strong> logic here and make an assertion. The algorithm will not care if a user actually checks if a value is <strong>less</strong> than another, as that assertion is completely arbitrary. This is analogous to the function used to compare values in C&#8217;s <code>qsort()</code></p>
<h6>Swap()</h6>
<p>Go takes the sort abstraction one step further, and also makes the user define a <code>Swap()</code> function. This is called after <code>Less()</code> returns <code>false</code> and the algorithm understands that a change is needed. In Go however, you can make <code>Swap()</code> do whatever you want in this case.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Sorting integers with <code>sort.Sort()</code></h2>
<p>A very basic example of defining a <code>sort.Interface</code> implementation is to create an integer alias in Go, and implement the required functions.</p>
<pre class="brush: golang; title: ; notranslate">
type Integers []int

func (s Integers) Len() int {
	return len(s)
}
func (s Integers) Swap(i, j int) {
	s[i], s[j] = s[j], s[i]
}
func (s Integers) Less(i, j int) bool {
	return s[i] &lt; s[j]
}
</pre>
<p>This implementation can now be passed to <code>sort.Sort()</code> and sorted on. A full working example of an integer sort with <code>sort.Sort()</code> can be found <a href="https://play.golang.org/p/uK1oECMLGP" target="_blank">here in the Go playground</a>, or my raw source <a href="https://github.com/Nivenly/nivenly.com/blob/master/examples/go/sort/integers.go" target="_blank">here on GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Sorting structs with <code>sort.Sort()</code></h2>
<p>Below is an example of sorting on a collection of custom types, and using the <code>utf8</code> package to sort on the <code>int32</code> value of a <code>rune</code>. This is important because it demonstrates how a user might want to sort on a &#8220;calculated&#8221; value instead of a literal value.</p>
<p>A user can implement any logic they wish in <code>Less()</code> or in <code>Swap()</code> giving the user a powerful opportunity to build quick and efficient sorting program on any type they can dream of. This is useful in situations where the logic for what a user wants to sort on, might be something different than a simple numerical or alphabetical sort.</p>
<pre class="brush: golang; title: ; notranslate">
type Type struct {
	Value string
}

type Types []Type

func (s Types) Len() int {
	return len(s)
}
func (s Types) Swap(i, j int) {
	s[i], s[j] = s[j], s[i]
}
func (s Types) Less(i, j int) bool {
	iRune, _ := utf8.DecodeRuneInString(s[i].Value)
	jRune, _ := utf8.DecodeRuneInString(s[j].Value)
	return int32(iRune) &gt; int32(jRune)
}
</pre>
<p>As always you can<a href="https://play.golang.org/p/iRTRdx_OnL"> run the code in Go Playground</a>, and also see <a href="https://github.com/Nivenly/nivenly.com/blob/master/examples/go/sort/customtype.go">the raw source in GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Go programming language offers a familiar and clean abstraction for sorting on arbitrary types and with arbitrary logic. The user can implement any logic they wish in regards to what the sort will use to sort on.</p>
<p>By offering the underlying algorithm and defining the <code>sort.Interface</code> the programming language helps us build powerful sorting programs without enforcing a single opinion on <strong>what</strong> the algorithm should do but rather <strong>how</strong> to do it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So today I decided to take on a fairly complex design pattern in the hopes of demonstrating some more advanced features of concurrency in Go or at least ruffle a few feathers about how to approach digraph processing.</p>
<p>Wikipedia offers a great explanation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory" target="_blank">graph theory</a> in case you need to brush up!</p>
<p>The goal of this post is to offer a design approach to processing graphs concurrently , where each vertex in the graph represents a processable unit of work .</p>
<p>The graph will be processed concurrently via a `Crawl()` operation, where there are N number of concurrent processors . Each processor will process a stream of vertices procedurally by referencing a function pointer to a `process()` function.</p>
<h2>The Graph</h2>
<p>The graph is composed of edges and vertices. We start the example off by building a complex graph with an arbitrary child count. Each of the children may or may not have their own children. A child is represented by a vertex.</p>
<h2>The Vertices</h2>
<p>A vertex represent the intersections of the graph. Where 2 edges intersect, there will be a vertex. The only way to get from one vertex to another is to traverse it&#8217;s corresponding edge.</p>
<h2>The Edges</h2>
<p>Edges are what connect vertices. Every edge has a `to` and a `from` pointer that will point to the two vertices it&#8217;s connecting. Because the edge insinuates direction, and only connects in a single direction that makes the graph a directional graph, or a digraph. </p>
<h2>The Processors</h2>
<p>Processors process vertexes. In this example we simulate some arbitrary work by injecting a random sleep. In a real implementation a processor would actually accomplish some amount of work that a vertex would require. We have N processors so they can operate on vertices concurrently. The more processors, the more vertices we can concurrently operate on, or process.</p>
<h2>The Crawler</h2>
<p>The crawler will traverse edges to find vertices. As the crawler finds a vertex it will concurrently process each vertex by passing it to a processor. Processors are called cyclically and in order. </p>
<p>For example if we had 10 vertices and 3 processors the call pattern would look like this.</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">
V -- P
------
1 -- 1
2 -- 2
3 -- 3
4 -- 1
5 -- 2
6 -- 3
7 -- 1
8 -- 2
9 -- 3
0 -- 1
</pre>
<p>The vertices to be processed in <strong>unique</strong> goroutines, but on <strong>shared</strong> channels. The channels will buffer and form a queue if the vertex workflow overflows their ability to keep up. </p>
<h2> The win </h2>
<p>The huge win here is that the graph stays constructed in it&#8217;s original form. The crawler can iterate through it&#8217;s many (and complex) layers quickly because of the concurrent processing design. A processor could be replaced with any implementation capable of running a workload. This allows the user to structure complex data, while operating on it without any overhead of understanding the data. The processor gets a vertex, and thats it. The processors have no concept of order, and they don&#8217;t need to.</p>
<p>Notice how the program is able to calculate the operations by counting the graph, and the graph is actually processed quickly with the same number of operations. Good. Clean. Concurrent processing.</p>
<p>Furthermore a user can turn up the number of iterations and specify how many times to visit each vertex. This is useful in situations were a process is idempotent but could potentially fail. Sending the same request N number of times makes sense and increases the probability of a success.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>Given 2 arbitrary integers X and N construct a tree such that the root has X child nodes, and each of the root&#8217;s children has N child nodes. Walk the graph touching each node only once and tracking the distance of each node from the root of the tree. For every node that has children, the parent node MUST BE visited first.</p>
