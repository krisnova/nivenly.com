# Official Rules

There is a perpetual game of chess between me and my email recipients that is going on, and you can make a move.

If you received an email from me you should have a chess board in my signature.

You can submit a move at any time by replying to one of my emails with a move and a name for the log.
I reconcile these manually, so syntax does not matter.

Whenever there is a checkmate I announce the winner and start a new game.

```
Hi Nóva,

Please make a chess move for me.

B2 -> A4

- Jax
```

I would then make Jax's move, make my move, and update my signature.
