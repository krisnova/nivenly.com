# Detection

The problem was identified around 15:10pm Pacific time when Kris Nóva's Spotify music stopped playing.

# Root Cause 

Our systems detected the outage for both incoming and outgoing traffic to our infrastructure. We later discovered the root cause to be _an outage with Comcast our ISP_.

# Recovery

We reset the gateway in the rack and all systems regained full operational status.
