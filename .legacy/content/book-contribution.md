I have picked you because I think you are awesome. 

I respect your thoughts and humbly ask you to consider sharing them in my book.

I am asking you to make a small contribution to my book coming out in 2022 [Hacking Capitalism](https://hackingcapitalism.io).


## Contribute a Quick Quote 🖊

Below is the official way to add or suggest a contribution to the book.
Any contribution type is welcome, although I ask that you keep it under 200 words -- or about the size of a single tweet.

Contributions may be used

 - In the content of the book directly
 - On the back cover of the book
 - On the website
 - On the front cover or sleeve of the book

### 🤷‍♀️ What can be contributed? 

 - A tweet
 - A quote
 - A reference to another piece of content (movie, book, play, song, etc)
 - A review of the book (if applicable)
 - A statement on my character or ability as a technologist or author

### 📚 What's in it for me?

You get a free copy of the book sent to your door.
You make me happy, and help me achieve my stupid dreams of becoming a respected author.
You help the world by giving a piece of thoughtful advice to newcomers to the tech industry.

### 🤔 How will you use my quote?

I am not going to take anything you say out of context.
The goal of the book is to improve the lives of younger marginalized technologists and equip them with real expectations about the industry.
It is in my best interest to share your language as authentically and positively as possible. 
I want you to look good, because I want my book to look good.

### 👀 Can I see my quote before it is published?

Yes. You will receive a digital copy immediately before publishing at which case you can opt in or opt-out at any time.
I won't print anything you don't love.

### 📓 What is the book about?

This is an independently published book about modeling the tech industry.

Particularly this book will model computers, humans, and money and their subsequent relationships.  

This book is designed so that any technologist will find value, however it specifically designed to give marginalized technologists (LGBTQ, Black people, People of Color, Women, Non-binary, Gender minorities, Neurodivergent, and more)
a set of tools in aiding their ability to exploit a fundamentally unbalanced system.
